The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a step-by-step process used to create software. It helps ensure that the software is built correctly, on time, and within budget. Here are the main steps:

---

### **1. Planning and Requirement Analysis**

* **Purpose**: Understand what the software needs to do.
* **Activities**: Talk to users to gather their needs. Plan how long the project will take and what resources are needed.
* **Outcome**: A list of **requirements** for the software.

---

### **2. Design**

* **Purpose**: Plan how the software will be built.
* **Activities**: Design the structure and layout of the software.
* **Outcome**: A **blueprint** for the software, showing how everything will work.

---

### **3. Coding (Development)**

* **Purpose**: Write the actual software.
* **Activities**: Developers write the code based on the design.
* **Outcome**: **Working software** that does what it is supposed to do.

---

### **4. Testing**

* **Purpose**: Make sure the software works properly.
* **Activities**: Test the software to find and fix any bugs or errors.
* **Outcome**: **Bug-free software** ready to be used.

---

### **5. Deployment**

* **Purpose**: Release the software to users.
* **Activities**: Install the software on user devices or servers.
* **Outcome**: The software is **live** and ready for use.

---

### **6. Maintenance**

* **Purpose**: Keep the software running smoothly.
* **Activities**: Fix any issues that come up and update the software as needed.
* **Outcome**: Regular **updates** and **improvements**.

---

### **Conclusion**

The SDLC helps create software step by step, ensuring it works correctly, is easy to use, and meets the users' needs. It includes planning, designing, coding, testing, deploying, and maintaining the software.
